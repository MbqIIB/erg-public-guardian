# Pre Interview Technical Questions

Three scenarios - q1, q2, q3

## Getting Started

To run q1. Run the following command - "vagrant up". This will create a Oracle VirtualBox Ubuntu VM and provision it with docker and docker compose and run docker-compose creating the nginx and postgres containers from library images.

To run q2. Again, run "vagrant up" This will also create a Oracle VirtualBox Ubuntu VM but this time provision it with ansible and run the ansible playbook. The ansible playbook creates an S3 instance and an EC2 instance.

To run q3. Simply execute the command "terraform apply". This will create a EC2 instance idempotently and configure the logicl volume /opt.
